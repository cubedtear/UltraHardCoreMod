# AFM

## About
AFM is a mod for the sandbox game Minecraft. The mod is developed by Aritzh (aka Aritzhack or Aritz Lopez), and it's intended to have as many modding-related features as possible, so that, in the future, I can use this as a tutorial for myself, and maybe even make a tutorial in the MinecraftForge wiki.
